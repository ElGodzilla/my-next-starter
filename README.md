## Next.js Sass / Framer-Motion Starter

For those who don't want to waste time on configuration !!

## ⚡ Quick Start 
You want to deploy it on Vercel ? Just click here ⬇️
[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/project?template=https://github.com/ElGodzilla/my-nextjs-starter)

## 🌠 Getting Started

Run the following command to create a new project with this Starter:

```
yarn create next-app my-app -e https://github.com/ElGodzilla/my-nextjs-starter
# or
npx create-next-app my-app -e https://github.com/ElGodzilla/my-nextjs-starter
```

Once the project and dependencies are finished installing, you can navigate to that directory and start up the development server with:
```
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see your new project!

## 🧐 What's inside?
This Starter includes [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) which is the best way (for me) to provide superpowers to your CSS.
It include also [Framer-Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) which is the best way (also for me 😜) to create awesome animation easily.

## 📁 Architecture of the folders
Because create folders and file can take some time for nothing here is what i added ⬇️
- assets/fonts/_fonts.scss
- assets/styles/_variables.scss, _reset.scss, app.scss
- components/Layout.js

## 👋 Good coding !!
